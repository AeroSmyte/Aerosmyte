## About Me 🧙🏾‍♀️
🖊️ I'm Lexi (she/he/they), a black, genderqueer **iOS developer** who has their bachelor's degree in **Computer Science**.

📱 I'm super interested in finding silly, stupidly useful apps for myself, my friends, and people like me-- a jack of all trades who loves playing music, working with their hands, watching movies, playing tabletop games, writing scripts, and communicating and collaborating across diverse groups! 

### Outside of iOS, you can find me:
- 👾 streaming games
- 🎻 playing instruments
- 📝 writing screenplays
- 💪🏾 exercising
- 🧗🏾‍♀️ rock climbing
